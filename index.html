      <div class="project-card">
        <video src="videos/.mp4" controls></video>
        <h3>Project One</h3>
        <p>React-based task manager with Firebase backend.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/project1" target="_blank">View on GitHub</a>
      </div>

         <div class="project-card">
        <video src="videos/ShockTube.mp4" controls></video>
        <h3> ShockTube</h3>
        <p>Step into a fully immersive VR environment where users operate within a realistic mining site. This interactive experience tasks players with analyzing terrain and strategically setting up explosive patterns to achieve optimal excavation results. Players must consider geological formations and follow timing protocols to minimize damage and ensure efficient material extraction. Designed for both training and educational purposes. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-card">
        <video src="videos/island.mp4" controls></video>
        <h3> Island Explorer – Dynamic Environment with Shader Animation</h3>
        <p>Step into a lush, stylized island crafted with Unity, where the environment feels alive. I implemented custom shaders to simulate natural wind movement across grass and palm leaves, adding immersive realism to this tropical landscape. This interactive experience allows players to freely explore the vibrant terrain, dynamic water reflections, and ambient atmosphere—all designed to showcase visual storytelling through technical artistry.</p>
      </div>

            <div class="project-card">
        <video src="videos/Sea.mp4" controls></video>
        <h3>Ocean Drift</h3>
        <p>Set in a tranquil ocean environment, this project lets users take control of a small boat and freely explore crystal-clear waters. Users can freely sail a boat through a serene ocean environment while dynamically adjusting water properties such as color, direction, and intensity through an intuitive UI panel. Though minimal in interactivity, the scene showcases my skills in  environmental lighting, and scene composition to create a visually immersive experience.</p>
      </div>

         <div class="project-card">
        <video src="videos/Building.mp4" controls></video>
        <h3>Virtual Showroom</h3>
        <p>Step into a sleek, futuristic showroom designed for exploration and immersion. Players can freely walk around the space, interact with visual displays, and enter dedicated rooms—such as a panoramic city view or a curated exhibit hall. This project focuses on atmosphere, layout, and guiding the player's attention using light, motion, and architecture. It's a foundation for virtual tours, product showcases, or even concept art galleries in interactive form.</p>

        <video src="videos/Watereffects.mp4" controls></video>
        <h3>Visual Dynamics</h3>
        <p>A focused technical scene demonstrating dynamic water motion and visual fidelity. This standalone test showcases surface behavior, wave interaction, and fluid aesthetics under various lighting conditions. It's a minimalist environment meant purely for testing and fine-tuning visuals.
